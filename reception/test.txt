Perception is the process of experiencing your world and then making sense out of what you experience. You experience your world through your five senses. Your perceptions of people, however, go beyond simple interpretations of sensory information.

Interpersonal perception is the process by which you decide what people are like and give meaning to their actions. It includes making judgments about their personalities and drawing inferences from what you observe.1

We perceive others either passively or actively. Passive perception occurs without effort, simply because our senses are operating. We see, hear, smell, taste, and feel things around us without any conscious attempt to do so. No one teaches you to be passively perceptive; you do it naturally and spontaneously.
